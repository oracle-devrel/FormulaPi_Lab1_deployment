You'll also explore the use of Oracle's APEX tool to create a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard for your eSports data. With its simplified development lifecycle and WYWASIG interface, APEX streamlines the development process, allowing you to focus on delivering a top-quality product that meets the needs of your users.
